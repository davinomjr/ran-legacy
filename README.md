# RAN-Legacy
An Android app for the RAN (Rapid Automatized Naming) test.

Rapid automatized naming (RAN) is a task that measures how quickly individuals can name aloud objects, pictures, colors, or symbols (letters or digits) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_automatized_naming)

The RAN test is used by speech therapists for diagnosing/treating individuals with reading disorder, specifically, Dyslexia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyslexia).

OBS: This project is currently being updated and (re)written in Kotlin: https://github.com/davinomjr/ran
